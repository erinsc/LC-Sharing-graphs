# LC-Sharing-graphs
Lambda Calculus interpreter using sharing graphs for optimal execution. The goal is to either implement the sharing graphs as described by A. Asperti and S. Guerrini 1998, or ideally create my own implementation with much lower conceptual complexity, if at the slight cost of efficiency.
